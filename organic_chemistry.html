This stability makes the conjugate base weaker and the parent acid stronger.</p>
                        <p>Physically, they have very high boiling points because they can form stable <strong>hydrogen-bonded dimers</strong>, which effectively doubles their molecular size and strengthens intermolecular forces.</p>

                        <p>Their chemistry is dominated by the acidity of the carboxyl group. They react with bases in neutralization reactions and, characteristically, with carbonates and bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide gas (a key qualitative test). They also undergo esterification with alcohols. Ethanoic acid (in vinegar) is a common preservative, while others are used to make soaps and polymers.</p>

                    content: `
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Esters are organic compounds containing the <strong>ester functional group (-COO-)</strong>. They are derived from the reaction of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Their general structure is \\(R-CO-OR'\\).</p>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Properties and Formation</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">Many lower molecular weight esters are volatile liquids with characteristic, often pleasant, fruity, or floral smells, making them valuable in perfumes and artificial flavorings. They have lower boiling points than comparable acids and alcohols because they cannot act as hydrogen bond donors.</p>
                        <p>The most common method of formation is <strong>Fischer esterification</strong>, a reversible acid-catalyzed reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. The yield can be maximized by using an excess of one reactant or by removing water as it forms.</p>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Hydrolysis</h3>
                        <p>Hydrolysis is the reverse of esterification. <strong>Acid hydrolysis</strong> is an equilibrium process. <strong>Alkaline hydrolysis (saponification)</strong> is irreversible because the carboxylic acid formed is immediately deprotonated by the base to form a stable carboxylate salt, driving the reaction to completion. This process is used to make soap from natural fats and oils, which are triesters of glycerol.</p>

                { q: "Explain how the hydroxyl group influences the physical properties of alkanols.", a: "The polar -OH group allows alkanols to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, giving them significantly higher boiling points and greater water solubility than alkanes of similar size." },
                { q: "Why do lower alkanols have high boiling points and water solubility?", a: "This is due to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds they can form with each other (raising boiling points) and with water molecules (increasing solubility)." },
                { q: "Explain the analogy between alkanols and water molecules.", a: "Alkanols (R-O-H) can be seen as derivatives of water (H-O-H) where one hydrogen is replaced by an alkyl group (R). This analogy helps explain the polar nature of the O-H bond." },
                { q: "How are alkanols classified, and why is this important?", a: "They are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°) based on the number of carbon atoms attached to the carbinol carbon. This is crucial as it determines their chemical reactivity, particularly in oxidation reactions." },
                { q: "Define a primary alcohol and give two examples.", a: "A primary (1°) alcohol has the -OH group attached to a carbon that is bonded to at most one other carbon. Examples: Ethanol (\\(CH_3CH_2OH\\)) and Propan-1-ol." },

                { q: "Outline the key IUPAC rules for naming alkanols.", a: "1. Find the longest carbon chain containing the -OH group. 2. Change the '-e' of the parent alkane to '-ol'. 3. Number the chain to give the -OH carbon the lowest possible number. 4. Name and number any substituents." },
                { q: "How is the position of the hydroxyl group indicated in an alkanol's name?", a: "By a number (locant) placed before the '-ol' suffix (e.g., propan-1-ol) or before the parent name (1-propanol)." },
                { q: "How are alkanols with multiple hydroxyl groups named?", a: "Prefixes like 'di-' or 'tri-' are used before '-ol', and the '-e' from the alkane name is retained (e.g., ethane-1,2-diol)." },
                { q: "Draw the structural formula for Ethanol and state its IUPAC name.", a: "IUPAC name: Ethanol. Formula: \\(CH_3CH_2OH\\)." },

                { q: "Explain isomerism in alkanols.", a: "Isomerism is when compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. In alkanols, this arises from different carbon chain structures (chain isomerism) or different positions of the -OH group (positional isomerism)." },
                { q: "Define chain isomerism and give an example.", a: "Chain isomers have the same functional group but different arrangements of the carbon skeleton. Example: Butan-1-ol and 2-methylpropan-1-ol (both \\(C_4H_{10}O\\))." },
                { q: "Define positional isomerism and give an example.", a: "Positional isomers have the same carbon skeleton but the functional group is at a different position. Example: Propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol." },

                { q: "How do structural differences among isomers affect their properties?", a: "Isomers have different physical properties (like boiling points) and can have different chemical reactivity due to molecular shape and steric hindrance." },
                { q: "What factors influence the choice of preparation method for an alcohol?", a: "Factors include the specific alcohol needed, cost and availability of starting materials, desired scale of production, and environmental considerations." },
                { q: "Describe the fermentation of sugars to produce ethanol.", a: "This biochemical process uses yeast enzymes to convert simple sugars like glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide, typically in warm water (~30°C). The reaction is \\(C_6H_{12}O_6 \\rightarrow 2C_2H_5OH + 2CO_2\\)." },
                { q: "How can the \\(CO_2\\) from fermentation be confirmed?", a: "By bubbling the evolved gas through limewater (calcium hydroxide solution), which turns milky due to the formation of a calcium carbonate precipitate." },
                { q: "What is the typical yield of ethanol from fermentation, and how is it concentrated?", a: "The yield is typically a 10-15% aqueous solution. It is concentrated by fractional distillation." },
                { q: "Describe the hydrolysis of alkenes via alkyl hydrogen sulphates.", a: "This is a two-step process. First, an alkene reacts with cold, concentrated sulfuric acid to form an alkyl hydrogen sulphate. Second, this intermediate is warmed with water to hydrolyze it, yielding the alcohol and regenerating the sulfuric acid." },
                { q: "What is Markovnikov's rule in this context?", a: "When adding sulfuric acid to an unsymmetrical alkene, the hydrogen adds to the carbon of the double bond that already has more hydrogen atoms." },
                { q: "Describe the industrial catalytic hydration of ethene.", a: "Ethene gas reacts with steam at high temperature (~300°C) and high pressure (60-70 atm) using phosphoric(V) acid as a catalyst to produce ethanol. The reaction is reversible: \\(C_2H_4 + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons C_2H_5OH\\)." },
                { q: "How is methanol industrially synthesized?", a: "Methanol is made from synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and \\(H_2\\)) using a catalyst (e.g., Cu/ZnO/Al₂O₃) at high pressure and temperature." },
                { q: "Compare fermentation and hydration of ethene based on raw material and renewability.", a: "Fermentation uses renewable biomass (sugars). Hydration uses non-renewable ethene from crude oil." },
                { q: "Compare fermentation and hydration of ethene based on reaction conditions and rate.", a: "Fermentation uses mild conditions (~30°C, 1 atm) and is slow. Hydration uses harsh conditions (~300°C, 60-70 atm) and is fast." },
                { q: "Compare fermentation and hydration of ethene based on yield and purity.", a: "Fermentation gives a low initial yield (~10-15% aqueous solution) that needs purification. Hydration has a high overall yield (~95%) due to recycling and produces a relatively pure product." },
                { q: "Define atom economy and compare it for the two ethanol production methods.", a: "Atom economy measures how many reactant atoms are incorporated into the desired product. Hydration of ethene has 100% atom economy. Fermentation of glucose has a lower atom economy (51.1%) because \\(CO_2\\) is produced as a byproduct." },
                { q: "Discuss the green chemistry trade-offs between fermentation and catalytic hydration.", a: "Fermentation is green because it uses renewable resources. Hydration is more efficient and continuous but relies on fossil fuels. The choice involves balancing sustainability with economic viability." },
                { q: "Describe the physical state and odor of lower alkanols.", a: "They are colorless, volatile liquids with characteristic, often 'alcoholic', smells." },
                { q: "Why are alkanol boiling points much higher than those of similar alkanes?", a: "This is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the -OH groups, which requires more energy to overcome than the weak Van der Waals forces in alkanes." },
                { q: "What is the trend for boiling points within the alkanol homologous series?", a: "Boiling points increase with increasing carbon chain length and molecular mass, due to increasing strength of Van der Waals forces." },
                { q: "Explain the high water solubility of lower alkanes.", a: "Their polar -OH groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them miscible." },
                { q: "Why does the water solubility of alkanols decrease with increasing chain length?", a: "As the non-polar alkyl chain (the hydrophobic part) gets larger, it dominates the molecule's character, disrupting water's hydrogen bonding network and making it less soluble." },
                { q: "What is the general trend for the density of alkanols?", a: "Most are less dense than water. Density tends to increase slightly with molecular weight." },
                { q: "Describe the combustion of alkanols.", a: "They are flammable and burn in excess oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat. The reaction is exothermic." },
                { q: "How do alkanols react with active metals like sodium?", a: "They react to liberate hydrogen gas and form a metal alkoxide. Example: \\(2CH_3CH_2OH + 2Na \\rightarrow 2CH_3CH_2ONa + H_2\\)." },
                { q: "How does the reactivity of alcohols with sodium vary?", a: "The rate of reaction generally decreases in the order: primary > secondary > tertiary, due to increasing steric hindrance." },
                { q: "Define esterification.", a: "Esterification is the reaction between an alkanol and a carboxylic acid to form an ester and water, typically catalyzed by a strong acid." },
                { q: "Write the general equation for esterification.", a: "\\(RCOOH + R'OH \\rightleftharpoons RCOOR' + H_2O\\)." },
                { q: "What are the two roles of concentrated \\(H_2SO_4\\) in esterification?", a: "It acts as both a catalyst and a dehydrating agent (to shift the equilibrium to the right)." },
                { q: "Outline the five key steps of the Fischer esterification mechanism.", a: "1. Protonation of the acid's carbonyl oxygen. 2. Nucleophilic attack by the alcohol. 3. Proton transfer to create a good leaving group (water). 4. Elimination of water. 5. Deprotonation to form the final ester." },
                { q: "What products are formed from alcohol oxidation?", a: "The product depends on the alcohol type: primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes then carboxylic acids; secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones; tertiary alcohols are resistant to mild oxidation." },
                { q: "What oxidizing agents are commonly used, and what are their color changes?", a: "Acidified \\(KMnO_4\\) (purple to colorless) and acidified \\(K_2Cr_2O_7\\) (orange to green)." },
                { q: "Describe the oxidation of primary alcohols.", a: "They are oxidized first to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids. To isolate the aldehyde, milder conditions or immediate distillation of the aldehyde are required." },

                { q: "Describe the oxidation of secondary alcohols.", a: "They are oxidized to ketones, which are resistant to further oxidation." },
                { q: "Why are tertiary alcohols resistant to oxidation?", a: "Because the carbinol carbon does not have a hydrogen atom attached to it, which is necessary for the oxidation reaction to proceed under mild conditions." },
                { q: "What is the chemical basis for the breathalyzer test?", a: "The oxidation of ethanol by orange potassium dichromate(VI). The extent of the color change to green is proportional to the amount of ethanol in the breath." },
                { q: "What products can be formed from the dehydration of alcohols?", a: "Either alkenes (intramolecular dehydration) or ethers (intermolecular dehydration), depending on the conditions." },
                { q: "Describe the conditions for intramolecular dehydration of ethanol.", a: "Heating ethanol with excess concentrated sulfuric acid at about 170-180°C produces ethene gas." },
                { q: "Outline the E1 mechanism for alcohol dehydration.", a: "1. Protonation of the -OH group. 2. Loss of water to form a carbocation intermediate. 3. Deprotonation of an adjacent carbon to form the alkene." },
                { q: "Describe the conditions for intermolecular dehydration of ethanol.", a: "Heating ethanol with concentrated sulfuric acid at a lower temperature, around 140°C, favors the formation of diethyl ether." },
                { q: "How is the product of dehydration controlled?", a: "By temperature and reactant ratios. Higher temperatures and excess acid favor alkene formation, while lower temperatures and excess alcohol favor ether formation." },
                { q: "List five uses of alkanols.", a: "1. Solvents (in perfumes, cosmetics). 2. Fuels (gasohol). 3. Antiseptics (ethanol). 4. Beverages (ethanol). 5. Chemical feedstock (for making other organic compounds)." },

                { q: "Explain the toxicity of methanol.", a: "Methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde and formic acid. Formic acid is highly toxic, causing metabolic acidosis and specifically damaging the optic nerve, which can lead to permanent blindness." },
                { q: "What is denatured alcohol (methylated spirit) and why is it made?", a: "It is ethanol that has been made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances like methanol and a dye. This is done to avoid the high taxes placed on beverage alcohol." },
                { q: "State the functional group and two types of isomerism for alkanols.", a: "Functional group: Hydroxyl (-OH). Isomerism types: Chain isomerism and Positional isomerism." },
                { q: "List and explain two key physical properties of alkanols.", a: "1. High boiling points due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. 2. Water solubility of lower members, also due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules." },

                { q: "Explain the trend in water solubility of alkanoic acids.", a: "Solubility decreases as the carbon chain length increases because the non-polar hydrocarbon tail becomes larger and more dominant." },
                { q: "Explain the trend in boiling points of alkanoic acids.", a: "Boiling points increase with molecular mass. They are significantly higher than corresponding alcohols." },
                { q: "Why are the boiling points of alkanoic acids higher than alcohols of similar mass?", a: "Because alkanoic acid molecules form stable dimers held together by two hydrogen bonds, which requires much more energy to break than the single hydrogen bonds between alcohol molecules." },
                { q: "Are alkanoic acids strong or weak acids? Explain.", a: "They are weak acids because they only partially dissociate in water. This is because the carboxylate anion formed is stabilized by resonance, making the proton donation more favorable than in alcohols but less than in strong mineral acids." },

                { q: "Describe two alternative, irreversible methods for ester synthesis.", a: "1. Reacting an alcohol with a more reactive acid chloride (RCOCl). 2. Reacting an alcohol with an acid anhydride (\\((RCO)_2O\\))." },
                { q: "Describe the characteristic odor of lower esters and give an example.", a: "They often have pleasant, fruity or floral smells. Example: pentyl ethanoate smells like bananas." },
                { q: "Why do esters have lower boiling points than comparable acids and alcohols?", a: "Because ester molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other, resulting in weaker intermolecular forces." },
                { q: "Discuss the solubility of esters in water.", a: "Lower esters are somewhat soluble because they can accept hydrogen bonds from water. Solubility decreases rapidly as the size of the hydrocarbon parts increases." },
                { q: "What is ester hydrolysis?", a: "It is the chemical breakdown of an ester into its parent carboxylic acid and alcohol by reaction with water." },
                { q: "Describe acid hydrolysis of esters.", a: "It is the reverse of Fischer esterification, an equilibrium process catalyzed by dilute acid, requiring excess water to drive it to completion." },
                { q: "Describe alkaline hydrolysis of esters (saponification).", a: "It is the irreversible hydrolysis of an ester using a hot aqueous alkali (like NaOH). It produces a carboxylate salt and an alcohol." },
                { q: "Outline the mechanism of saponification.", a: "1. Nucleophilic attack by OH⁻ on the carbonyl carbon. 2. Formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. 3. Expulsion of the alkoxide leaving group. 4. Rapid, irreversible deprotonation of the newly formed carboxylic acid by the strong alkoxide base." },
                { q: "Why is alkaline hydrolysis preferred for complete ester cleavage?", a: "Because it is an irreversible reaction, it goes to completion and thus gives a higher yield of the products (carboxylate salt and alcohol)." },
                { q: "What are fats and oils chemically?", a: "They are triglycerides, which are triesters formed from one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of long-chain fatty acids." },
                { q: "Distinguish between fats and oils based on their structure and properties.", a: "Fats are rich in saturated fatty acids, allowing their straight chains to pack closely, making them solids at room temperature. Oils are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, whose 'kinks' prevent close packing, making them liquids at room temperature." },
                // Detergents
                { q: "What is the primary function of detergents, and what two categories do they fall into?", a: "Their primary function is to enhance water's cleaning ability. They fall into soapy detergents (soaps) and soapless (synthetic) detergents." },
                { q: "Explain the amphiphilic nature of detergent molecules.", a: "They have two distinct parts: a long, non-polar hydrophobic tail that dissolves in grease, and a polar, ionic hydrophilic head that dissolves in water." },
                { q: "How do the hydrophilic heads of soaps and synthetic detergents differ?", a: "Soaps have a carboxylate (\\(-COO^-\\)) head. Synthetic detergents typically have sulphonate (\\(-SO_3^-\\)) or sulphate (\\(-OSO_3^-\\)) heads." },
                { q: "What is hard water and how does it affect soaps?", a: "Hard water contains dissolved \\(Ca^{2+}\\) and \\(Mg^{2+}\\) ions. Soaps react with these ions to form an insoluble precipitate called scum, which reduces their effectiveness." },
                { q: "What are soaps chemically and how are they produced?", a: "They are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids, produced by the alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) of fats and oils." },
                { q: "Explain the cleaning action of a soap molecule.", a: "The hydrophobic tails dissolve in grease, while the hydrophilic heads stay in the water. Agitation breaks the grease into small droplets (micelles) which are emulsified in the water and washed away." },
                { q: "List three common types of soapless detergents.", a: "1. Anionic (e.g., sodium alkylbenzene sulphonates). 2. Cationic (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts). 3. Non-ionic (e.g., polyoxyethylene derivatives)." },
                { q: "Outline the industrial manufacture of sodium alkylbenzene sulphonates.", a: "It involves three main steps: 1. Alkylation of benzene. 2. Sulphonation of the alkylbenzene. 3. Neutralization of the resulting sulphonic acid with NaOH." },
                { q: "What are two significant advantages of soapless detergents over soaps?", a: "1. They work effectively in hard water because their calcium and magnesium salts are soluble. 2. They remain effective in acidic solutions." },
                { q: "What is eutrophication and how can detergents cause it?", a: "Eutrophication is the excessive growth of algae in water bodies. It can be caused by phosphates used as 'builders' in detergents, which act as nutrients for algae. The subsequent decay of the algae depletes oxygen in the water." },
                // Polymers
                { q: "Define polymers, monomers, and polymerization.", a: "Polymers are large macromolecules composed of many repeating structural units derived from smaller molecules called monomers. Polymerization is the process of linking these monomers." },
                { q: "Classify polymers based on their source.", a: "1. Natural (e.g., rubber, cellulose). 2. Synthetic (e.g., polyethene, nylon). 3. Semi-synthetic (e.g., cellulose acetate)." },
                { q: "What are the two main types of polymerization reactions?", a: "Addition polymerization and Condensation polymerization." },
                { q: "Distinguish between linear, branched, and cross-linked polymers.", a: "Linear polymers have straight chains. Branched polymers have side chains. Cross-linked polymers have adjacent chains joined by covalent bonds, forming a 3D network." },
                { q: "Define addition polymerization and its key characteristic.", a: "It is the process where unsaturated monomers add to each other sequentially to form a polymer chain without the loss of any small molecules. The empirical formula of the polymer is the same as the monomer." },
                { q: "Outline the three main steps of addition polymerization.", a: "1. Chain Initiation (formation of an active species). 2. Chain Propagation (sequential addition of monomers). 3. Chain Termination (stopping the chain growth)." },
                { q: "For Polyethene, name its monomer, repeating unit, and uses.", a: "Monomer: Ethene (\\(CH_2=CH_2\\)). Repeating Unit: \\(-[CH_2-CH_2]-_n\\). Uses: Packaging films, bags, bottles." },
                { q: "For PVC, name its monomer, repeating unit, and uses.", a: "Monomer: Chloroethene (vinyl chloride, \\(CH_2=CHCl\\)). Repeating Unit: \\(-[CH_2-CHCl]-_n\\). Uses: Pipes, window frames, flooring." },
                { q: "For PTFE, name its monomer, repeating unit, and uses.", a: "Monomer: Tetrafluoroethene (\\(CF_2=CF_2\\)). Repeating Unit: \\(-[CF_2-CF_2]-_n\\). Uses: Non-stick coatings (Teflon), seals." },
                { q: "For Perspex, name its monomer, repeating unit, and uses.", a: "Monomer: Methyl methacrylate. Repeating Unit: \\(-[CH_2-C(CH_3)(COOCH_3)]-_n\\). Uses: Transparent sheets, lenses." },
                { q: "How is the degree of polymerization calculated?", a: "Degree of polymerization (n) = (Relative molecular mass of polymer) / (Relative molecular mass of monomer)." },
                { q: "Define condensation polymerization and its key characteristics.", a: "It is a process where monomers with two or more functional groups react to form a polymer with the elimination of a small molecule (like water). The empirical formula of the polymer differs from that of the monomers." },
                { q: "For Nylon 6,6, identify its monomers and the type of linkage formed.", a: "Monomers: Hexane-1,6-diamine and Hexane-1,6-dioic acid. Linkage: Amide linkage (-CO-NH-)." },
                { q: "What is vulcanization and how does it improve rubber properties?", a: "Vulcanization is the process of heating raw rubber with sulphur. This forms sulphur cross-links between the polymer chains, which increases the rubber's strength, elasticity, and temperature stability." }
